# Login Page Project

## Description

This Login Page is a web application designed to demonstrate my skills in building user interfaces using React and TypeScript. This is a simple login page with validation of the email address and password and saving the email address locally.

## Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Formik
- Yup
- Tailwind CSS
- react-toastify

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
What you need to install the software:

Node.js
npm

### Installation

Clone the repo

### `git clone https://github.com/khprzybyl/loginPage.git`

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Usage

Enter your email and password to log in. The login button is enabled only when the form fields are filled out correctly according to the validation rules. The email address will be saved in local storage when you click login button.

## Improvments

I used I18n, if I had more time I would install a library for managing strings properly.
